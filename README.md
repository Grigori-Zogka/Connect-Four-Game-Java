Connect four Game. Java

Connect Four is a popular two-player connection game in which the players  take turns dropping one colored disc 
from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the 
lowest available space within the column. The goal of the Connect Four game is to be the first player to form a horizontal, 
vertical, or diagonal line of four of oneâ€™s own discs.
